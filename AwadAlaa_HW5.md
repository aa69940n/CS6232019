	WHERE p.prod_id=s.prod_id  AND s.dep_id='d2';
	```

	b.
	```
	SELECT pname
	FROM Product
	WHERE prod_id IN (
	SELECT prod_id from Stock
	WHERE dep_id='d2');
	```


3. #prod and names of the products that are out of stock. (a) without in/not in (b) with in/not in

	a.
	```
	SELECT p.prod_id, p.pname

	GROUP BY p.prod_id, p.pname
	HAVING SUM(quantity) <= 0;
	```

	b.
	```
	SELECT prod_id, pname

	SELECT d.addr
	FROM Depot d

	INTERSECT
	(SELECT prod_id FROM product WHERE price <= 400);

	b.
	```
	SELECT prod_id FROM product WHERE price >= 250 AND  price <= 400;
	```

6. How many products are out of stock?
	```
	SELECT COUNT(ps.prod_id)
	FROM (
	SELECT prod_id
	FROM stock s
	GROUP BY prod_id
	HAVING sum(quantity)<=0
	) ps;
	```


7. Average of the prices of the products stocked in the ”d2” depot.
	```

	```

8. #deps of the depot(s) with the largest capacity (volume).
	```
	SELECT dep_id
	FROM depot
	WHERE volume = (select MAX(volume) FROM depot);
	```

9. Sum of the stocked quantity of each product.
	```
	SELECT prod_id, SUM(quantity) FROM stock GROUP BY prod_id;
	```

10. Products names stocked in at least 3 depots. (a) using count (b) without using count

	a.
	```
	SELECT pname FROM product WHERE prod_id IN (
	SELECT prod_id FROM stock
	GROUP BY prod_id  HAVING COUNT(dep_id)>=3
	);
	```
	b.
	```
	SELECT p2.pname FROM
	(SELECT prod_id, SUM(1) as num_deps
	 FROM stock GROUP BY prod_id) p1, product p2
	WHERE p1.prod_id=p2.prod_id AND p1.num_deps>=3;
	```


11. #prod stocked in all depots. (a) using count (b) using exists/not exists

	a.
	```
	SELECT prod_id
	FROM stock
	GROUP BY prod_id
	HAVING count(dep_id) = (SELECT count(dep_id) FROM depot);
	```

	b.
	```
	SELECT p.prod_id
	FROM product p
	WHERE NOT EXISTS
		(SELECT  d.dep_id
	 	FROM  depot d
	        		EXCEPT
	SELECT s.dep_id
	FROM stock s
	WHERE s.prod_id = p.prod_id);
